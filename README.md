# Professor's notes and comments

Intended broad functionality:
- Log in & log out
  - No need for sign up options, that is not in our scope
- New customer
  - Aparently we were missing something in the new customer screen as per the supplied new customer form. 
- Take order & simulate order
  - How is an order generated with customer information and the contents of the order? - (sprint 1 feedback)

> How does delivery fulfillment fit into the sales rep ordering process? 
This was scope creep on our side, we do NOT need content submitted on this topic.
